A number of system assurance approaches are adopted by industries in the safety-critical domain. However, the task of constructing assurance cases remains a manual, lenghty and informal process. The Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM) is a standard specified by the Object Management Group (OMG). SACM provides a richer set of features than existing system assurance languages/approaches. SACM provides a foundation for model-based system assurance, which bears great application potentials in growing technology domains such as Open Adaptive Systems. However, the intended usage of SACM has not been sufficiently explained. In addition, there has not been support to interoperate between existing assurance case (models) and SACM models.In this article, we explain the \u2026"

In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud \u2026"

We create an optimisation framework looking for the switching sampling periods and time instants that maximise the control performance (indexed by settling time) and resource efficiency (indexed by the number of tasks that are schedulable on the processor).

However, the gate control list (GCL), as a simple mechanism for achieving timing determinism for safety-critical traffic (ST) frames with hard deadlines, is too rigid to handle the intrinsic timing uncertainty of automated driving systems (ADSs). Due to the complexity and the unpredictable operating environment, there can be delayed ST frames that can disrupt the solidly fixed timing behavior. In this work, we present one novel approach to effectively use bandwidth resources to deal with delayed ST frames, which cannot be handled by a traditional fixed GCL, and the discarding of them should be reduced to improve the system\u2019s integrity. An acceptance test is implemented to report to the application layer when an ST frame will miss its deadline and hence be rejected, i.e., prevented from \u2026"

Moreover, such an I/O system also requires to manage I/O resource in an adaptive manner to facilitate efficient yet safe resource sharing among components of different criticality levels. Existing approaches cannot achieve all of these requirements simultaneously. This article presents a mixed-criticality I/O management framework, termed MCS-IOV.

For real-time applications, I/O operations are often required to be timing-predictable, i.e., bounded in the worst case, and timing-accurate, i.e., occur at (or near) an exact desired time instant. Unfortunately, both timing requirements of I/O operations are hard to achieve from the system level, especially for many-core architectures, due to various latency and contention factors presented in the path of instigating an I/O request. This paper considers a dedicated I/O co-processing unit, and proposes two scheduling methods, with the necessary hardware support implemented. It is the first work that guarantees timing predictability and maximises timing accuracy of I/O tasks in the multi-and many-core systems."

Such a strategy can be controversial and has proven difficult to implement in practice, as it can lead to hazards and reduced functionality due to the absence of the discarded tasks. To mitigate this issue, the imprecise mixed-critically system model (IMCS) has been proposed. In such a model, instead of completely dropping less-critical tasks, these tasks are executed as much as possible through the use of decreased computation precision. Although IMCS could effectively improve the survivability of the less-critical tasks, it also introduces three key drawbacks - run-time computation errors, real-time performance degradation, and lack of flexibility.

In this paper, we first introduce the notion of dynamic worst-case execution time (dWCET), which forms a new perspective that could help a system to predict potential timing failures and optimize resource allocations. We then have a comprehensive review of trend prediction methods. In the evaluation, we make a comparative study of dWCET trend prediction. Four prediction methods, combined with three data selection processes, are applied in an evaluation framework. The result shows the importance of applying data preprocessing and suggests that non-parametric estimators perform better than parametric methods."

Interleaved jobs, belonging to other tasks with different behaviours, can cause stress on those resources by disrupting the execution history thus slowing down more sensitive tasks. Schedulability analyses and policies tend to ignore such behaviours, in favour of conservative assumptions, as their effects are difficult to assess. When they are included, the analysis can be very complex and the measures needed are hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose abstract timing models that capture stress and sensitivity with respect to the memory hierarchy. The advantage of an abstract timing model is that it can be derived through measurements without the need for a detailed understanding of the precise cache hierarchy \u2026"

To start with, while scheduling theories for simple task models and uniprocessors have been well established, multiprocessors are being deployed and dependencies between tasks need to be considered. In addition, reliability is a safety-related issue, especially when there is large-scale resource sharing. On communication, the in-vehicle backbone network is migrating to Ethernet. Eventually, scheduling/controller co-design from the cyber-physical systems (CPS) perspective is desired. In this chapter, we present three interconnected fundamental works along the above directions.

This typically leads to a considerable decrease in the system\u2019s Quality-of-Service (QoS). Achieving more graceful degradation is critical to minimizing QoS reduction.

Without this, the system would be unlikely to achieve a holistic functional quality of service (QoS) and may not meet safety goals.

Instead of discarding computational load at the application level, a qualitative and quantitative definition of importance order is used to assist in realizing finer-grained task-level degradation and preserve more LO-criticality tasks. The causality analysis-based degradation bridges the gap where functional dependencies are not considered in the scheduling design and, thus, leads to the system being able to continue to run with relatively high QoS during the degradation process.

To achieve this, tools need to be implemented that can enable exploration of design options and be able to detect deficiencies earlier to avoid costly system re-design. In this work we discuss the challenges of design of multi-core realtime systems with timing assurance and discuss what are the requirements for modelling, testing and analysis tools. Digital Twin-based predictive modelling and fast design space evaluation are studied that work toward addressing these challenges."

                "abstract": "In a Cyber-Physical Control System (CPCS), there is often a hybrid of hard real-time tasks which have stringent timing requirements and soft real-time tasks that are computationally intensive. The task scheduling of such systems is challenging and requires flexible schemes that can meet the timing requirements without being over-conservative.  Fixed-priority scheduling (FPS) is a scheduling policy that has been widely used in industry. However, as an open-loop scheduler, FPS has low system dynamics and no feedback from historic operation. As the working conditions of a CPCS will change due to both internal and external factors, an improved scheduling scheme is required which can adapt to changes without a costly system redesign.  In recent years, there is a large research interest in the co-design of control and scheduling systems that explicitly considers task scheduling during the design of a controller. Many of these works reveal the possibility of adapting control periods at run-time in order to accommodate varying resource requirements and to optimise CPU utilization. It is also shown that control quality can be traded off for resource usages.  In this thesis, an adaptive real-time scheduling framework for CPCS is presented. The adaptive scheduler has a hierarchical structure and it is built on top of a traditional FPS scheduler. The idea of dynamic worst-case execution time is introduced and its cause and methods to identify the existence of a trend are discussed. An adaptation method that uses monitored statistical information to update control task periods is then introduced. Finally, this method is extended by proposing a dual-period \u2026"

These control strategies also should be designed with consideration of the run-time behavior of the system. One of such research attempts is to design the controller along with the task scheduler, known as control-scheduling co-design, for more predictable timing behavior as well as surviving system overloads. Unlike traditional controller designs, which have equal-distance sampling periods, the co-design approach increases the system flexibility and resilience by explicitly considering timing properties, for example using an event-based controller or with multiple sampling times (non-uniform sampling and control). Within this context, we introduce the first work on the discretization of an energy-based controller that can switch arbitrarily \u2026"

                "abstract": "Emerging real-time applications have driven the transition to multicore embedded systems, where tasks must share resources due to functional demands and limited availability. These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average."

Runtime enforcement of scheduling constraints can be effective in eliminating timing anomalies and providing timing guarantees; however, it is unnecessary for anomaly-free scheduling scenarios, leading to non-work-conserving schedules and deliberate utilization loss.

However, the traditional methods either do not consider DAGs, or rely on sophisticated static analysis to produce fixed scheduling solutions that require additional hardware support (e.g., cache partitioning and colouring), which undermines both the applicability and flexibility of these methods. Recently, an online cache-aware DAG scheduling method has been presented that schedules DAGs using an execution time model with caching effects considered, eliminating the need for static analysis and additional hardware support \u2026"
